# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system built with Go. The project is currently in the planning/initialization phase with architecture and requirements being defined in the following documents:

- `tech-stack.md` - Technology stack decisions
- `domain-architecture.md` - Domain-driven design architecture
- `database-design.md` - Database schema and design
- `product-requirements.md` - Product requirements and specifications

## Project Status

**This project is in the initial planning phase.** Before implementing features, ensure you:

1. Review the architecture documentation files to understand the planned structure
2. Follow the technology choices specified in `tech-stack.md`
3. Align implementations with the domain architecture outlined in `domain-architecture.md`
4. Reference database design constraints from `database-design.md`

## Development Commands

To be added once the project structure is initialized. Expected commands will include:

- Building the application
- Running tests
- Database migrations
- Running the development server

## Architecture Notes

Architecture details will be documented here once the codebase structure is established. The project plans to follow domain-driven design principles as outlined in the planning documents.
